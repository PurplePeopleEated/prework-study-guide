        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>is used to create the structure of a webpage</li>
          <li>is made up of elements that combine to provide content and basic framework for all webpages</li>
          <li>element: type of content on a webpage
            <ul>
              <li>common element types:
                <ul>
                  <li>text elements</li>
                  <li>image elements</li>
                  <li>header elements</li>
                  <li>list elements</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>element types used to divide and describe a page
            <ul>
              <li>meta-related elements</li>
              <li>content division elements</li>
              <li>semantic elements</li>
            </ul>
          </li>  
          <li>two elements important to understanding how the structure works: head & body elements
            <ul>
              <li>head element: contains info about the webpage</li>
              <li>body element: represents the visible content shown to the user</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>metadata: data about a webpage that the browser uses to serve a webpage to users</li>
          <li>common meadata tags for head element:
            <ul>
              <li>title: absolutely required(especially for SEO) and defines the title for the webpage</li>
              <li>style: defines the CSS styles asociated with a website</li>
              <li>base: defines the base URL for a webpage</li>
              <li>link: connects an external resource to the HTML document</li>
              <li>meta: defines metadata like the character set(charset), HTTP header for content(http-equiv)description, keywords, author, and viewport</li>
              <li>script: embeds client-side scripts in the HTML document</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="card" id="css-section">
        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>aka Cascading Style Sheets</li>
          <li>is used to define how content is presented to users</li>
          <li>three ways to style using CSS:
            <ol>
              <li>inline CSS: applies to a specific HTML tag, using a style attribute with a CSS rule to style a particular page element only</li>
              <li>internal CSS style sheet: contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML document that only applies to that page</li>
              <li>external CSS style sheet: all CSS rules are kept in a separate file(preferred by most developers)</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>separation of concerns: separating code into different files based on use</li>
          <li>a margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element</li>
          <li>a padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="card" id="git-section">
        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
          <li>GitHub Flow:
            <ol>
              <li>create a feature branch</li>
              <li>make commits of all the changes we make to the code while working with a descriptive message attached</li>
              <li>push changes to the feature branch in the GitHub repo with a PR or pull request</li>
              <li>once PR is opened, others on your team can evaluate your code, and you can resolve conflicts between branches</li>
              <li>once PR is approved, it can be merged with the main branch and becomes the new main branch</li>  
            </ol>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="card" id="javascript-section">
        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>a dynamic language that allows users to interact with websites</li>
          <li>variable: a named container that allows us to store data in our code
            <ul>
              <li>example: var person = "alive";</li>
              <li>the variable is named (person), the assignment operator (=) says we want to store the data ("alive") in (person)</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>string: always contained within quotation marks</li>
          <li>console: a test environment that developers use to check out their code</li>
          <li>method: a set of instructions that can be executed by a computer
            <ul>
              <li>example: .log() will output whatever is added inside the parentheses to the console</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>MAKE SURE TO LINK THE JAVASCRIPT FILE TO THE HTML DOCUMENT OR IT WON'T WORK
            <ul>
              <li>add this code under the footer element and above the closing element for the body:
                <ul>
                  <li>(script src="add filepath here")(/script)</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Chrome DevTools: a very important tool that has several capabilities</li>
          <li>control flow: the order in which a comoputer executes code in a script</li>
          <li>in JavaScript, code starts from the first statement at the top and ends at the last statement at the bottom</li>
          <li>conditional statments and loops can be used to control the order in which code is executed or if it even is</li>
          <li>if statement
            <ul>
              <li>code will only execute if the statement meets a condition/is true</li>
              <li>you can have more than one condition by using else if</li>
              <li>syntax for an if statement:
                <ul>
                  <li>if (first condition) { block of code to be executed if first condition is truthy goes in here</li>
                  <li>} else if (second condition) { block of code to be executed if second condition is truthy goes in here }</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>=== is a strict equality operator aka it checks to see if two values are equal and returns a Boolean result(true/false)</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>array: a single variable that is used to hold a group of data</li>
          <li>arrays are mostly used for related data sets and can store different types of data</li>
          <li>syntax for an array:
            <ul>
              <li>var variableName = [var1, var2, var3];</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>all arrays are indexed in the order named aka var1 = 0, var2 = 1, var3 = 2</li>
          <li>length: command to pull the built-in property of an array</li>
          <li>for loop: uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing repeated exectution of a code block
            <ul>
              <li>contains three important statements:
                <ol>
                  <li>the starting point for our loop where we declare a variable and give it a value</li>
                  <li>the condition: as long as the number in the associated variable is less than the length of the array, the loop will keep running</li>
                  <li>the final statement is what allows the arrray to iterate over each items
                    <ul>
                      <li>the number of an index increases by 1 each time aka x+1</li>
                      <li>x++ is a shortcut way of x+1</li>
                      <li>every time the code loops, x will increase by 1</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                </ol>
              </li>
              <li>all code that we want to be executed for each loop is put inside curly brackets{}</li>
              <li>for loop syntax:
                <ul>
                  <li>for(var x = 0; x (less than carrot) variableName.length; x++) { code block goes in here }</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>function: a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task
            <ul>
              <li>functions don't auto execute when the JavaScript file is run</li>
              <li>they must be called by name in order to be executed</li>
              <li>parentheses must be included whenever writing a function</li>
              <li>syntax for a function named helloWorld:
                <ul>
                  <li>function helloWorld() { code block goes in here }</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Math: built-in object in JavaScript that can be used in various ways</li>
              <li>Math.random() and Math.floor() can be used together to generate a random number</li>
              <li>syntax for random number generation:
                <ul>
                  <li>var variableName = Name[Math.floor(Math.random() * Name.length)]</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
